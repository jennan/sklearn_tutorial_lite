This repository contains notebooks and other files associated with the [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) tutorial.
The notebooks have been updated by NeSI (http://github.com/nesi/sklearn_tutorial.git) to run with recent versions of Python and dependencies.

Recordings of the original workshop are available on Youtube:

## Installation Notes

You can run the notebooks directly in your web browser at https://jennan.github.io/sklearn_tutorial_lite.

If you prefer to run on your own computer then we recommend that you download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Once Miniconda is installed, navigate to your local copy of the repository and use the following command to create a Conda environment with all required packages:

```
conda env create -f environment_local.yml
```

Then activate your environment:

```
conda activate skl_tut
```

The tutorial material has been tested with the following package versions:

- Python version 3.10.5
- `numpy` version 1.22.4: https://www.numpy.org
- `scipy` version 1.8.1: https://www.scipy.org
- `matplotlib` version 3.5.2: https://matplotlib.org
- `scikit-learn` version 1.1.1: https://scikit-learn.org
- `jupyterlab` version 3.4.3: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io
- `ipywidgets` version 7.7.0: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io
- `pandas` version 1.4.2: https://pandas.pydata.org/


## Downloading the Tutorial Materials

We have already installed all the notebooks on [NeSI JupyterHub](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/).
However, if you prefer to run on your laptop, you will need to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nesi/sklearn_tutorial.git
```

Note also that some of the code in these notebooks will not work outside the directory structure of this tutorial, so it is important to clone the full repository if possible.


## Notebook Listing

If you have followed the installation instructions to run on your laptop, start `JupyterLab`:

```
jupyter lab 
```

Then navigate the directory structure.
The notebooks are under the directory `notebooks`.
Click on `Index.ipynb` to get started.
